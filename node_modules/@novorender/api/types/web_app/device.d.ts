 * GPU performance tier.

 * This is a rough estimate of the capabilities of a device GPU.

 * As a general guide, these are the targets for the different tiers:
 * - 0: Unknown GPU - A weak android device. Also the fallback tier for unknown GPUs.
 * - 1: IOS, IPad, high-end android device, weak integrated (intel) GPU
 * - 2: Mac M1 or better, strong integrated GPU or weak/old discrete GPU.
 * - 3: Discrete GPU, mid to high end.

 * @param tier The performance level of device GPU, 0-3, where 0 is weakest.

 * @remarks
 * A simple tier system is probably too simplistic but provides a starting point.
 * The resulting device profile may be modified further before passing it into the {@link View} constructor.
